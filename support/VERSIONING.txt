The following files contain a version (semver) number and need to be
adjusted:

  <repo>/package.json
  <repo>/lib/ClojureScript.coffee
  <repo>/lib/packaging/licensing.js


Before manual release:

  remove the '-pre' tag from the version number, in the files listed above


After manual release:

  Bump the version number and add a '-pre' tag, in the files listed above


Eventually these steps will be encapsulated in cake tasks:

  cake set-ver [semver# | if not spec'd then invoke inc-ver]
      should set ver num in package.json

  cake use-ver [semver# | if not spec'd then use ver num from package.json]
      should write ver num in files listed above, BUT NOT README.md ... that
      file should only be adjusted as part of the release task

  cake inc-ver
      should pull the ver num from package.json, increment the patch segment and
      return the adjusted value (don't write to any files)
